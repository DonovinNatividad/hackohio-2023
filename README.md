# hackohio-2023
This is the working repository for our HackOHIO project for 2023. We are planning on doing Engie's challenge, creating a website/dashboard showcasing our sustainability project idea. Our idea is focused on creating a behavioral change on campus and focusing on promoting one of Ohio State's resource stewardship goals to create real change on campus.
